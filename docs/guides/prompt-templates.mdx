## Required Templates

Python and TypeScript `Agent` both require:

- `planPrompt`
- `reasonPrompt`
- `actPrompt`

## Supported Placeholders

- `{goal}`
- `{examples}`
- `{plan}`
- `{observation}`
- `{reasoning}`
- `{history}`

## Template Guidance

- Keep `plan` concise and structured.
- Keep `reason` focused on current observation and progress.
- Keep `act` strict: ask for a single action/command.

## Minimal Set

```text
PLAN: Goal: {goal}\nExamples:\n{examples}\nCreate a short numbered plan.

REASON: Goal: {goal}\nPlan: {plan}\nObservation: {observation}\nHistory:\n{history}\nExamples:\n{examples}\nThink step by step.

ACT: Goal: {goal}\nPlan: {plan}\nReasoning: {reasoning}\nObservation: {observation}\nRespond with one action only.
```

## Python Unified XML Mode

Python `ReActLoop` detects XML-style prompts when `plan_prompt` includes markers like `<keystrokes` or `<response>`. In that mode, reasoning/commands are parsed from model XML output.

Use this only if your environment expects XML-structured actions.
