## Utility Tracking

Curation tracks retrieval outcomes per trajectory:

- retrieval count
- success count after retrieval
- derived utility score

A trajectory is considered for pruning only after minimum retrieval evidence.

## Python Curation Details

Python metadata also includes:

- deferred validations (`DeferredValidation`)
- persistence score updates
- deprecation and supersession fields

This enables pruning decisions that combine retrieval success and post-hoc validation signals.

## TypeScript Curation Details

TypeScript curation currently uses retrieval-based signals via `CurationManager` plus storage metadata fields.

## Trigger Model

`CurationManager.maybe_curate()` increments episode counter and runs pruning every `curate_every` episodes (default `10`).
