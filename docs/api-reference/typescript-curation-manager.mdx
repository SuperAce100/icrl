title: "CurationManager"
description: "Automatic curation for trajectory databases"
---

## Constructor

```ts
new CurationManager(database: TrajectoryDatabase, options?: CurationManagerOptions)
```

`CurationManagerOptions` includes:

- `threshold` (default: 0.3) — utility score below which trajectories are pruned
- `minRetrievals` (default: 5) — minimum retrievals before a trajectory can be pruned
- `curateEvery` (default: 10) — run curation after this many successful episodes

## Methods

```ts
await curation.maybeCurate();
await curation.curate();
curation.getUtilityScores();
curation.getLowUtilityTrajectories();
```

- `maybeCurate` — checks if curation should run (by episode count) and runs it if so
- `curate` — prunes low-utility trajectories, returns removed IDs
- `getLowUtilityTrajectories` — IDs that would be pruned if curation ran now
