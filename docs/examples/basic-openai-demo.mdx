description: "Minimal ICRL run with OpenAI — the fastest way to verify your setup"
---

## Overview

The basic OpenAI demo is the smallest possible ICRL example. It uses a trivial environment that succeeds after one action, runs a single training episode, and prints the result. Use it to confirm your API key and environment are working.

## Prerequisites

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your environment
- Python 3.12+
- `icrl-py` installed

## Run

```bash
uv run python examples/basic_openai_demo.py
```

Optional model override (default is `gpt-4o-mini`):

```bash
MODEL=gpt-4o-mini uv run python examples/basic_openai_demo.py
```

## What It Does

1. Creates a `MinimalEnvironment` that accepts any action and returns success
2. Creates an `Agent` with `LiteLLMProvider` and basic prompts
3. Runs one `agent.train()` call with goal `"Demonstrate one minimal training run"`
4. Prints model, success status, and step count

## Expected Output

```
Model: gpt-4o-mini
Success: True
Steps: 1
```
