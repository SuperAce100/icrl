## Source Files

- `examples/mock_llm.py`
- `tests/test_with_mock.py`

## Why Use It

- deterministic responses
- fast local iteration
- zero API cost

## Run

```bash
uv run python tests/test_with_mock.py
```

## Provider Contract

The mock implements the same method as any Python provider:

```python
async def complete(messages: list[Message]) -> str:
    ...
```

You can swap `MockLLMProvider` with `LiteLLMProvider` without changing `Agent` wiring.
