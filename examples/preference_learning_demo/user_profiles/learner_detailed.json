Unlike merging, which creates a new commit, rebasing rewrites the commit history to create a linear sequence.\n\n### Why Use Rebase?\n\n- **Cleaner history**: Your commits appear in a straight line\n- **Easier to understand**: No merge commits cluttering the log\n- **Better for code review**: Each commit is a logical unit\n\n### How to Rebase\n\n1. First, make sure you're on the branch you want to rebase:\n   ```bash\n   git checkout feature-branch\n   ```\n\n2. Then run the rebase command:\n   ```bash\n   git rebase main\n   ```\n\n### ⚠️ Warning\n\nNever rebase commits that have been pushed to a shared branch...",
