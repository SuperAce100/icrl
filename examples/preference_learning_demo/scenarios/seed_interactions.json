This is useful for cleaning up your commit history before merging.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Start interactive rebase**:\n   ```bash\n   git rebase -i HEAD~3\n   ```\n   This opens your editor showing the last 3 commits.\n\n2. **Modify the commit list**:\n   You'll see something like:\n   ```\n   pick abc1234 First commit message\n   pick def5678 Second commit message\n   pick ghi9012 Third commit message\n   ```\n   \n   Change `pick` to `squash` (or just `s`) for commits you want to combine:\n   ```\n   pick abc1234 First commit message\n   squash def5678 Second commit message\n   squash ghi9012 Third commit message\n   ```\n\n3. **Save and close** the editor.\n\n4. **Edit the combined commit message**:\n   Another editor opens where you can write a new message for the squashed commit.\n\n### ⚠️ Important Notes\n\n- The first commit must stay as `pick`\n- Only squash commits that haven't been pushed yet\n- If you've already pushed, you'll need to force push: `git push --force`\n\n### Why Squash?\n\n- Cleaner git history\n- Easier code reviews\n- Each commit represents a complete feature",

You can:\n- `git commit -m 'New message'` - commit with a better message\n- `git reset HEAD` - unstage to modify further\n- `git diff --staged` - review what's staged",
